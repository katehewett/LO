### This code is designed to perform all the operations associated with adding dye veriables to existing forcing files. Unlike other forcing code it operates on several different types of files:
- history file for IC
- clm and bry files for boundary forcing
- river file for point sources

Initially I am going to code this for a single experiment, but I expect it will take some careful design work to make it a useful tool.
