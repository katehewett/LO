# README for cast extractor

### This code is a key part of the process for model validation. It uses our pre-processed bottle and ctd observations to find the times and places to do a "cast extraction" from the model. A cast extraction is a vertical profile of model fields at a single time and place, stored in a single NetCDF file.
