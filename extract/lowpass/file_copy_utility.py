"""
Custom code to help Parker copy lowpassed files to his laptop.

** WARNING: I think this code it not ready for general use. It fails too
often even when I run it with an ethernet cable in my UW office.
Running from the bash command line does not help.

Example call, from my mac:
run file_copy_utility -gtx cas7_t0_x4b -0 2013.01.01 -1 2013.01.03

Issue: I have to manually enter my password for each file transfer.
This was easily solved using the usual steps (on my mac):
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id parker@apogee.ocean.washington.edu
as described in the readme for LO_roms_user.
